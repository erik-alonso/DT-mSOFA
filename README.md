Cost-Sensitive Decision Tree for Mortality Prediction

This repository contains MATLAB code for training, optimizing, and evaluating a cost-sensitive decision tree (DT) model to predict in-hospital mortality using routinely collected clinical biomarkers.

The code accompanies a scientific manuscript and is intended to promote transparency, reproducibility, and methodological clarity.
